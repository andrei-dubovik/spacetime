* TODO A Simple Clock
  - [X] An FSP counter (you need an FPS counter to see your FPS)
  - [ ] Check FPS for a smooth second hand
    - [ ] Second hand is a part of a clock svg
    - [ ] Second hand is a separate svg
    - [ ] If FPS is low, consider canvas
  - [ ] SVG clock
    - [ ] Dial
    - [ ] Minute hand
    - [ ] Second hand
  - [ ] Animation
  - [ ] Recheck FPS and CPU utilization with a dozen clocks or so
    - [ ] Firefox
    - [ ] Chrome
    - [ ] Safari
    - [ ] CPU only (i.e. no GPU acceleration)
* TODO Interface Sketch
  - Considerations
    - Ship's reference frame PoV
    - Rotation is fixed
    - Point and click sets ship's destination
    - No change of direction mid-flight (in the first version)
    - Tin-can spaceship design
    - Spaceship Dashboard (on a side)
      - Ship's own clock (i.e. eigenzeit)
      - Speed, acceleration
    - Game dashboard (say, under the spaceship dashboard)
      - FPS
      - Co-op latency
* TODO Interface Implementation
  - Mobile-compatible from the start
* TODO Physics Engine
* TODO Co-op Play
  - via WebRTC
* Questions
  - Planets can be shown where they are now (presumably), or where
    they were when the light started its journey from them towards the
    ship. The ship from the co-op player must be shown where it was,
    because it has an uncertain itinerary. So, what choice for the
    planets?
