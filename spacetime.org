* TODO A Simple Clock
  - [X] An FSP counter (you need an FPS counter to see your FPS)
  - [X] Check FPS for a smooth second hand
    - Firefox: about 0.20ms per 16.6ms frame, 96.8% idle time
    - Chromium: about 0.6ms per 16.6ms frame, 96.6% idle time
  - [X] SVG clock
    - [X] Dial
    - [X] Minute hand
    - [X] Second hand
  - [ ] Animation
  - [ ] Recheck FPS and CPU utilization with 4 clocks (3 planets + proper time)
    - [ ] Firefox
    - [ ] Chrome
    - [ ] Safari
    - [ ] CPU only (i.e. no GPU acceleration)
* DONE Interface Sketch
  - Considerations
    - Ship's reference frame PoV
    - Rotation is fixed
    - Point and click sets ship's destination
    - No change of direction mid-flight (in the first version)
    - Tin-can spaceship design
    - Spaceship Dashboard (on a side)
      - Ship's own clock (i.e. eigenzeit)
      - Speed, acceleration
    - Game dashboard (say, under the spaceship dashboard)
      - FPS
      - Co-op latency
    - Dark theme
* DONE Basic Interface
  - Mobile-compatible from the start
  - [X] A clock (+ calibrate scaling across smaller and bigger screens)
  - [X] Sidebar (big screen) / statusbar (small screen)
  - [X] 3 planets (should fit on screen with either planet centered)
  - [X] Spaceship
* TODO Physics Engine
  - [ ] Fixed acceleration schedule
    - [ ] Set some acceleration wrt proper time
    - [ ] Ship worldline in planetary IRF
    - [ ] Animate ship motion in planetary IRF
    - [ ] Ship's simultenaity plane and its intersection with planetary worldlines
    - [ ] Animate ship motion in ship's RF
    - [ ] Stats (acceleration, velocity, etc.)
  - [ ] Simple route planning (from a stop to a stop in a straight line)
  - [ ] Relativistic doppler effect (adjusted for visibility)
* Questions
  - Planets can be shown where they are now (presumably), or where
    they were when the light started its journey from them towards the
    ship. The ship from the co-op player must be shown where it was,
    because it has an uncertain itinerary. So, what choice for the
    planets?
* Possible Extensions
  - [ ] Co-op Play (via WebRTC, interface time = planetary time)
  - [ ] Fastest route plotting
  - [ ] Anti-matter and matter have to be carried and contribute to mass
  - [ ] GR and black holes (how do define distances so that there is a map?)
  - [ ] Infinite grid of clocks
  - [ ] Ship in isometric projection (a nod to classic video games)
